Raw material to create a video/post illustrating how Twitter helps CA state senator Richard Pan hide from dissent

Your task: create a video or a post using this raw material based on https://twitter.com/DrPanMD/status/1501988008760774669

Call out both @DrPanMD on censorship, and Twitter on enabling such censorship.

DO NOT MAKE THIS A PARTISAN ISSUE. *Everyone* who isn't an extreme authoritarian should oppose a state senator being able to hide from dissent like this.

DO NOT BRING OTHER ISSUES INTO THIS. Only make it about censorship.

If you do either of those, Pan wins. The goal is for Pan to lose, big.

Share your post, try to get as many people to see it as possible.

Share it with Pan's colleagues, point out to them he can't handle dissent.

Consider filing a Public Records Act Request (I don't know if that only covers agencies).

Call out Twitter executives on enabling censorship like this.
