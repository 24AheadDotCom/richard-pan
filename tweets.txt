THESE ARE SOME OF THE REPLIES FROM THE THREAD:






@myrablackisback
Your entire narrative has fallen apart so now you’re talking “long Covid?”


@AliaRenee2
So are the long term injuries from the vaccine. But children are not at risk from this disease and you damn well know it! Stop trying to terrify parents.


@beautybysela
The vaccines  do not prevent  infection and you should  know that



@jaime90640
Definitely not voting for you !



@hardypartymom
Leave us and our kids alone.



@C3smoorevp
@P_McCulloughMD can you please have a discussion with Peter Pan here.  Vaccinate is a choice



@miss_jody
Tell us how much payout you received from big pharm to push this anti-science agenda evil man



@miss_jody
Pan, a Sacramento pediatrician and chair of the Senate Health Committee, took in at least $432,000 from health care interests during the 2017-18 election cycle. That amounts to 40 percent of the money in both his personal campaign account and a ballot measure committee he formed



@Scotty_Doo_Wop
You are completely out of step with the data and the world. Retire already



@tblue17
Please do not fear monger about long covid in kids.“These studies indicate that long Covid in children is rare and, when it does occur, is short-lived.”

@leoDantes3
LOL. My two kids got covid for 24 hours. What the hell are you talking about. You will pay one day.



@Hplc23
Do you really need those legislations??? [image of the bills discussed in https://calmatters.org/health/coronavirus/2022/03/california-vaccine-laws/]



@miss_jody
#WashingtonState advisory group has decided against recommending a COVID-19 vaccine requirement for students in K-12 schools, citing lack of long-term data and potentially unpredictable social impacts from imposing a mandate.

She replies to herself with two more tweets with an image of that page and a highlight from the text.
@TeoMiz replies to the @miss_jody tweets with "Uh huh. Nameless, faceless advisors. Really credible".
Note that Pan hid the @miss_jody tweets but kept the @TeoMiz reply in place



@burrrgers
Less and less people are buying your bullshit every day

@miss_jody
Stop pushing your fear already!  Why is only California not safe!!   STOP THE LIES.  you’re the one pushing misinformation.  Criminal what you’re doing!



@blahXthree21
hiding all your negative replies.  youre getting ratio’d like crazy but deleting them.  one word - COWARD




@jay_franz87
Bought and paid for by Big Pharma. Dick Pan your in the pocket of Big Pharma and it shows way to continue to push the vax




@jay_franz87

ABUSIVEQUALITY SECTION:







@mighty_tired
Stop. Just stop.





@BrendaLL70
Idiot read the data that came out. Never safe and effective. You’re an evil person for continuing to push poison.






@CaliBayGirl87
Dick, when there is risk there must be choice.  Basic bioethics101.  Risk of vax outweighs benefit, entire COUNTRIES are recognizing this.

@FrancieNolan6
If "long Covid" were even a fraction of the issue you people make it out to be, the entire health care system and maybe the economy, would collapse. Stop lying. Everyone will get Covid eventually, almost all will recover just fine.





@BrianWa15996406
This man is a fanatic and should be arrested




@lovelycoconut
But getting vaccinated won’t stop transmission and my kids already had covid. Where do we fit in to your overreaching government plan?




@Karalis_jana
With a vaccine that doesn’t prevent infection? Kids have a minuscule risk and you know it, your bill is horrendous and will destroy public education.




@parella_anthony
Please go away and stay away from our children.   You're not a truthful person.




@peaceyknowledge
I have not met or heard of a single IRL kid with long Covid.   You telling me to ignore my lying eyes?




@gohardgx
It’s not gov job to dictate, mandate, or force medical decisions on people. #Freedomofchoice #mybodymychoice #justsayNOtotyranny




@chrstne7
Fraudulent numbers. You're a crim.  inal.





@CaliBayGirl87
STOP HIDING RESPONSES!  How disingenuous are you that your bills can’t stand on their own and you have to delete legitimate discussion?




@houmanhemmati
Why “especially children”? You DO understand they’re the lowest risk. This is backwards thinking. Talk to @DrJBhattacharya and @MartyMakary and pretty much any other doc, who will tell you that we must focus on those who are at HIGHEST risk, not the other way around.

@nicolle99953150
The hearing where you cut the phones lines and ended public comment when it was clear the public has had enough of your Pharma fascism? That hearing?




@DHATE2020
PISS OFF...RESIGN Why do you hate Science?



@StillKP
I hear your financial connections to the pharmaceutical industry are being investigated by the AMA and the CA ethics review board. About time!

@grasshoppa13
Jesus, a zero COVID nut.  More proof, if not we're necessary, that the phd after the name doesn't mean shit anymore.




@SurlMudgeon
How much did this group donate to your last campaign?




@nikita40572392
You have blood on your hands



@Westside4Bernie
"especially children??"   They are literally the LEAST at-risk.   Stop your assault on OUR children




@thebeachagain10
Could you please confirm that you've read the recently released Pfizer documents regarding adverse events?  Vaccines aren't the answer, maybe research early treatments




@heather_alfano
You should stay out of my family’s medical business.




@BangBan64924090
You covidians are absolutely bonkers




@mgelizabethx
Majority of children have been exposed, and this was before the peak of Omicron. UK is estimating 90% of 5-11 yos, this is without vaccination. Give it up, Pan.

@RichLeMond
Is the long covid in the room with us now?  https://twitter.com/theysayitsrare






@AngryMomOf5and2
Just leave our kids alone. 12% efficacy that wanes after 1 month is not worth the risks to most healthy children and certainly shouldn’t be worth a MANDATE.





@Wabi_Sabi_Anon

@SylvanDeLaCruz
A completely unrealistic goal. Also, lockdowns delayed the pandemic entering the endemic stage, and caused far more short term and long term harm to society than covid did. Healthy children and teens are essentially at zero risk with the virus. All restrictions should be lifted.




@MarissaMorale14
Why are so many responses hidden?? Is Pan anti-freedom of speech too?




@JBrady70373767
Here we go, Dick Pan once again hiding all replies that don't conform to the Big Pharma narrative. You have zero credibility, especially when Pfizer's own data show thousands of vaccine-related deaths and millions of adverse events.





[several more replies, including those citing studies Pan doesn't want people to see, etc etc.]
